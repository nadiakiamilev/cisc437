Index Description

For our database we had 2 indices that we used for our queries.

The first index was a Hash index on the attributes first_name
and last_name in the table person.  This index was important because
the primary key on the table person was a person_id.  We ran equality 
searches on this table many times in our queries, and Hash indices
are fast on equality searches.  We had to make the storage engine 
for the person table MEMORY.

The SQL code was as follows:

CREATE INDEX person_index ON person (first_name, last_name) HASH;

The second index we need to have was a B-TREE index on the attribute
year in the table date.  This index was important because we have
a query that runs range queries on ths year attribute in date.  B-Trees
are the best indices to handle range queries.

The SQL code was as following:

CREATE INDEX year_index ON date (year) BTREE;
